# Quest-Drone-Simulator
This is my C# logic from a drone simulation game I have been working on for Oculus Quest VR headsets. Currently the drone is implemented and flying overhead on an autpilot course. Projectiles can be fired from the drone, and physics have been implemented to reflect velocity, trajectory, and impact. There is a CCTV style screen at the player cockpit displaying a real-time view from the drone's gimbal.

## Future Development
- Despawn projectiles on contact
- Implement VR cockpit controls
- Implement manual flight controls and mounted camera gimbal controls
- Add production effects
- Add production assets
